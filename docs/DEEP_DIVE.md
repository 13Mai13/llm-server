The architecture follows a layered approach:

1. **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests, routing, and request validation
2. **LLM Layer**: Manages LLM provider interactions and optimizations
3. **Validation Layer**: Ensures structured input/output and type safety
4. **Metrics Layer**: Collects and tracks performance metrics

### Technical Details

#### Connection Pooling and Batch Processing

The system implements two distinct approaches for handling LLM requests:

1. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Shared across all endpoints (structured and unstructured)
   - Manages HTTP connections to LLM providers
   - Optimizes resource utilization
   - Handles connection lifecycle
   - Key features:
     - Maximum connection limits
     - Connection reuse
     - Timeout management
     - Error handling

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - Only used for unstructured endpoints
   - Improves throughput by grouping requests
   - Not used for structured endpoints due to:
     - Schema validation requirements
     - Direct generation needs
     - Outlines library constraints


#### Implementation Details

1. **Connection Pool**:
   - Global pool per provider
   - Async context manager for connection acquisition
   - Automatic connection cleanup
   - Resource limits enforcement

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - Dynamic batch size
   - Timeout management
   - Error handling
   - Metrics collection

3. **Structured Generation**:
   - Outlines library integration
   - Schema validation
   - Direct generation
   - Error handling

### Validation Layer Details

The Validation Layer is a critical component that ensures:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Schema validation using Pydantic
   - Type checking for all inputs
   - Custom validation rules
   - Request size limits

2. **Output Validation**:
   - Structured output schemas
   - Type checking for LLM responses
   - Format validation
   - Content validation

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Structured error responses
   - Error categorization
   - Detailed error messages
   - Error recovery strategies

4. **Type System**:
   - Strong typing for all data structures
   - Custom type definitions
   - Type inference for LLM outputs
   - Type conversion utilities

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Framework Selection
- **Chosen**: FastAPI
- **Rationale**: 
  - Built-in async support
  - Automatic OpenAPI documentation
  - Type hints and validation
  - High performance

### 2. Connection Management
- **Chosen**: Connection Pooling
- **Rationale**:
  - Reduces connection overhead
  - Better resource utilization
  - Easier to manage connection limits

### 3. Metrics Collection
- **Implemented**: Custom metrics collector
- **Features**:
  - Request timing metrics
  - Token usage tracking
  - Error rate monitoring
  - Performance tracking

## Performance Testing

This was tricky to perform since I'm using a MacBookAir, with colima and docker running on top. All the requests are hitting the same container, therefore what we are trying to test is container's performance within its resource constraints.

### Settings

1. CPU Allocation:
   * 2 CPUs allocated to Colima

2. Memory Allocation:
   * 2GiB of memory allocated to Colima
   * Docker shows 1.914GiB total memory (this is normal as some memory is used by the system)

3. Other Resources:
   * 60GiB disk space

### Testing Scenarios

We compared structured vs unstructured output endpoints across different models and test cases:

1. **Simple JSON Object** (23 input tokens, 46 output tokens)
2. **Nested JSON Object** (48 input tokens, 396 output tokens)
3. **Array of Objects** (68 input tokens, 760 output tokens)

Models tested:
- llama3-8b-8192 (Groq)
- gpt-3.5-turbo
- gpt-4
- claude-2
- claude-3-opus
